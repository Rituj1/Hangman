There are two files - Hangman.py and hang.py. hang.py is imported in the Hangman.py so it is important to have both files.
This is a program for hangman game written solely in Python.

You will be given a clue to work with and you'll get 6 lives. You have to select a letter and enter as you see fit. If the entered letter is correct,
you will notice that the character on your screen isn't drawn fully and thus not hanged but if you enter a wrong letter, in 6 steps the character will 
be drawn fully and you will be hanged to death and you lose.
